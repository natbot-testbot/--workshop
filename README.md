## Project Purpose and Features

**NatBot Workshop** is an interactive chess platform integrated with GitHub workflows, enabling contributors to play chess games, earn SOL (Solana's cryptocurrency) as bounties, and utilize AI assistance for move suggestions. This project leverages GitHub pull requests and issues to manage gameplay, bounty distribution, and game validations, fostering a collaborative and engaging environment for chess enthusiasts and developers alike.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engage in chess games by submitting moves via GitHub pull requests.
- **Automated Bounty System**: Earn SOL rewards for successful and validated moves.
- **AI Assistance**: Utilize AI to analyze games and receive optimal move suggestions.
- **Move Validation**: Ensure all submitted moves comply with standard chess rules.
- **Transparency**: Maintain accountability through recorded bounty transactions and game histories.
- **Automated Workflows**: Streamline processes with GitHub Actions for adding bounties, validating games, and paying out rewards.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **pnpm**: Preferred package manager
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```
- **TypeScript**: Installed as a development dependency
- **Solana Wallet**: For handling SOL transactions
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for AI functionalities

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/natbot-testbot/workshop.git
   cd workshop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided `.env.example`:

   ```env
   SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_solana_private_key
   SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

   **Note**: Never expose your private keys or sensitive information publicly. Ensure your `.env` file is secure and added to `.gitignore`.

## Configuration

Ensure all necessary environment variables are correctly set in your `.env` file:

```env
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_solana_private_key
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### Understanding the Configuration Files

- **package.json**: Defines project dependencies, scripts, and package information.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file specifying compiler options.
- **.prettierignore**: Specifies files and directories to ignore during code formatting with Prettier.
- **.github/workflows/**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for automating tasks like adding bounties, validating games, and paying out rewards.
- **chess/games/**: Directory storing PGN files of ongoing and completed chess games.

## Usage

### Playing a Game

1. **Submit a Pull Request with Your Move**

   - Fork the repository and clone your fork:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/workshop.git
     cd workshop
     ```
   - Navigate to the `chess/games/` directory and locate the current game's `.pgn` file.
   - Make your move by editing the `.pgn` file following the [PGN format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation).
   - Include your Solana wallet address in the PR description.
   - Submit the pull request.

2. **Bounty Payout**

   - If your move is accepted and merged into the main branch, the automated workflow will process your bounty.
   - Your SOL reward will be sent to the provided wallet address.
   - Transaction details will be recorded in the `.bounties` folder.

### AI Assistance

Leverage AI to analyze your games and receive move suggestions.

1. **Analyze and Suggest Next Move**

   Run the AI assistant script with the game's PGN file:
   ```bash
   pnpm ts-node chess/scripts/aiChessAssistant.ts chess/games/game_<game_id>.pgn
   ```
   The script will output the suggested SAN-formatted move based on the current board state.
