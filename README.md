## Usage

### Playing a Game

1. **Start a New Game**

   To create a new game, run the following script:

   ```bash
   pnpm ts-node chess/scripts/createNewGame.ts your_github_username
   ```

   This will generate a new PGN file in the `chess/games` directory.

2. **Submit Your Move**

   - Fork the repository and navigate to the `chess/games` directory.
   - Open the latest game PGN file and add your move following the PGN format.
   - Commit your changes and submit a Pull Request (PR) with your move.
   - Include your Solana wallet address in the PR description.

3. **Earn Bounty**

   - If your move is valid and accepted, a GitHub Action workflow will automatically process the bounty.
   - You will receive SOL tokens in your provided wallet address as a reward for your contribution.

### Bounty Payout Process

Bounties are managed through a structured and transparent process to ensure fairness and accountability:

1. **Bounty Creation**

   - Bounties are defined in YAML files located in the `.bounties` directory.
   - Each file specifies the task, reward amount, and criteria for completion.

2. **Task Completion**

   - Contributors work on the specified tasks by submitting PRs with their moves.
   - Each valid move submitted via a PR qualifies for a bounty.

3. **Review and Approval**

   - Project maintainers review the submitted moves to ensure they adhere to chess rules.
   - Approved moves trigger the bounty payout process.

4. **Payment**

   - Upon approval, the bounty reward is transferred to the contributor's Solana wallet.
   - Payment details are recorded in the respective YAML file in `.bounties`.

5. **Record Keeping**

   - All transactions and bounty completions are documented in the `.bounties` folder for transparency.
