## Project Purpose and Features

**Play Chess With Me** is designed to create an engaging chess-playing experience integrated with the Solana blockchain. The project allows contributors to play chess by submitting their moves via Pull Requests (PRs) and earn SOL as bounties for valid moves. This setup encourages community participation, enhances the game's dynamics, and ensures transparency in bounty payments.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Chess Gameplay**: Play chess by submitting your moves through GitHub PRs.
- **SOL Bounties**: Earn SOL rewards for validated moves directly to your Solana wallet.
- **Automated Validation**: Scripts ensure that all submitted moves are valid and conform to chess rules.
- **Bounty Management**: Transparent and fair payout process managed via YAML configurations.
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows to automate bounty payments and game validations.
- **AI Assistance**: Leverage OpenAI's GPT-4 to suggest moves and analyze games.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js (version 20) installed.
- **pnpm**: Package manager used for dependencies. Install it [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- **Solana Wallet**: A Solana wallet to receive bounty rewards.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure your `.env` file with the necessary keys.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/natbot-testbot/--workshop.git
   cd --workshop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash

     ```

   - Populate the `.env` file with your Solana private key and RPC URL:

     ```
     SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
     SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

## Bounty Payout Process

Our bounty system ensures that contributors are rewarded fairly and transparently for their efforts. Here's how the process works:

1. **Bounty Creation**

   - Bounties are defined in YAML files located in the `.bounties` directory.
   - Each file specifies the task, reward amount, and criteria for completion.

2. **Task Completion**

   - Contributors work on the specified tasks, such as making valid chess moves.
   - Submit your work via Pull Requests.

3. **Review and Approval**

   - Project maintainers review submitted work to ensure it meets the bounty criteria.
   - Approved contributions are eligible for bounty payouts.

4. **Payment**

   - Upon approval, the bounty reward is transferred to the contributor's Solana wallet.
   - Payment details, including transaction hashes, are recorded in the respective YAML files.

5. **Record Keeping**

   - All transactions and bounty completions are documented for transparency.
   - Previous payments are accessible in the `.bounties` folder.
