2. **Task Completion**

   - Contributors complete tasks by submitting pull requests with their contributions (e.g., chess moves).

3. **Review and Approval**

   - Project maintainers review submitted work.
   - If the contribution meets the criteria, it is approved for a bounty payout.

4. **Payment**

   - Upon approval, the specified SOL bounty is transferred to the contributor's Solana wallet.
   - Transaction details are recorded in the respective bounty YAML file.

5. **Record Keeping**

   - All transactions and payouts are documented in the `.bounties` folder for transparency.
