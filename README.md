## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ngundotra/--workshop.git
   cd --workshop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed. Then, install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   **.env**

   ```env
   SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_solana_private_key
   SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

   - Replace `your_solana_private_key` with your Solana wallet's private key.
   - Optionally, set up the `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you intend to use the AI Chess Assistant.

4. **Build the Project**

   Compile the TypeScript code:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

## Usage

### Submitting a Move

To participate in a chess game, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/--workshop.git
   cd --workshop
   ```

3. **Make Changes**

   Navigate to the `chess/games` directory and locate the latest game PGN file. Submit your next move by editing the PGN file with your proposed move.

4. **Include Your Solana Wallet Address**

   Ensure you include your Solana wallet address in the PR to receive SOL bounties upon acceptance.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**

   Push your changes and create a PR to the original repository. If your move is accepted, you will receive SOL as a bounty.

### AI Chess Assistant

Leverage the AI Chess Assistant to analyze games and suggest optimal moves.

1. **Run the Assistant**

   ```bash
   pnpm ts-node chess/scripts/aiChessAssistant.ts path/to/game.pgn
   ```

   Replace `path/to/game.pgn` with the path to the game file you want to analyze.

2. **Review Suggestions**

   The assistant will output the suggested SAN-formatted move. You can incorporate this move into your game by submitting a PR.

## Bounty Payout Process

Bounties are managed through a structured and transparent process to ensure fairness and accountability.

1. **Bounty Creation**

   Bounties are defined in YAML files located in the `.bounties` directory. Each file corresponds to a specific PR number and specifies the task, reward amount, and Solana wallet address.

2. **Task Completion**

   Contributors submit their moves via PRs. Once a move is reviewed and accepted by maintainers, it qualifies for a bounty.

3. **Review and Approval**

   Maintainers review submitted moves to verify their validity. Upon approval, the bounty payout process is initiated.

4. **Payment**

   The `payBounty.ts` script handles the transfer of SOL to the contributor's wallet. It ensures that payouts are executed securely and recorded appropriately.

5. **Record Keeping**

   All bounty transactions are logged in the corresponding YAML files within the `.bounties` directory, maintaining a transparent record of all payouts.
