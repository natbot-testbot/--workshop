# Play Chess With Me

Want to play chess? Here's how:

1. Submit a PR with your next chess move
2. Include your Solana wallet address in the PR
3. If I accept your move, I'll send you SOL as a bounty!

Previous bounty payments can be found in the `.bounties` folder.

## Bounty Payout Process

Bounties are paid out through a structured process to ensure transparency and fairness. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Bounty Creation**: Bounties are defined in YAML files located in the `.bounties` directory. Each file specifies the task, reward, and criteria for completion.

2. **Task Completion**: Contributors work on the tasks specified in the bounties. Once a task is completed, it is submitted for review.

3. **Review and Approval**: The submitted work is reviewed by the project maintainers. If the work meets the criteria specified in the bounty, it is approved.

4. **Payment**: Upon approval, the bounty reward is paid out to the contributor. The payment details and method are specified in the bounty file.

5. **Record Keeping**: All transactions and bounty completions are recorded for future reference and transparency.
