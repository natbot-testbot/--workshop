## Project Purpose and Features

**Play Chess With Me** is designed to create an engaging chess-playing experience through collaborative contributions. By leveraging GitHub's pull request mechanism and Solana's blockchain capabilities, players can submit their moves, validate games, and earn SOL bounties for successful contributions.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Chess Games**: Play chess by submitting your moves via pull requests.
- **Bounty System**: Earn SOL rewards for accepted moves.
- **Automated Validation**: Ensure the integrity of games with automated scripts.
- **AI Assistance**: Get move suggestions from an integrated AI assistant.
- **Transparent Transactions**: All bounty payments are recorded for transparency.
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows to automate validations and payments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20.x
- **pnpm**: Package manager (version 9.x recommended)
- **TypeScript**: Installed as a dev dependency
- **Solana Wallet**: For handling bounties
- **Environment Variables**: Configure using a `.env` file

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/natbot-testbot/--workshop.git
   cd --workshop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have `pnpm` installed. If not, install it globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

   Then, install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Fill in the required values:

   - `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Solana wallet private key.
   - `SOLANA_RPC_URL`: Solana RPC endpoint, e.g., `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`.
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (if using AI features).

4. **Set Up TypeScript**

   The project uses TypeScript. Ensure it's properly configured by checking the `tsconfig.json` file.

## Usage

### Playing a Game

1. **Submit a Pull Request with Your Move**

   - Fork the repository and clone your fork.
   - Navigate to the `chess/games` directory.
   - Open the latest game `.pgn` file and add your move in SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation).
   - Commit and submit a pull request.

2. **Include Your Solana Wallet Address**

   In your pull request description or commit message, include your Solana wallet address to receive bounties if your move is accepted.

3. **Await Bounty Payment**

   If your move is valid and accepted by the maintainers, a bounty in SOL will be sent to your provided wallet address. Previous bounty payments are recorded in the `.bounties` folder.

### Running Scripts

The project includes several scripts to manage and validate games.

- **Validate All Games**

  ```bash
  pnpm ts-node chess/scripts/validateGames.ts
  ```

- **Create a New Game**

  ```bash
  pnpm ts-node chess/scripts/createNewGame.ts <github-username>
  ```

- **Analyze and Suggest Moves with AI**

  ```bash
  pnpm ts-node chess/scripts/aiChessAssistant.ts <path-to-pgn-file>
  ```

- **Pay Bounties**

  ```bash
  pnpm ts-node scripts/payBounty.ts
  ```

## Bounty Payout Process

Bounties are managed through a structured and transparent process to ensure fairness and accountability.

1. **Bounty Creation**

   Bounties are defined in YAML files located in the `.bounties` directory. Each file corresponds to a pull request number and specifies the task, reward amount, and criteria for completion.

2. **Task Completion**

   Contributors submit their moves via pull requests. Upon submission, the corresponding bounty YAML file is updated with the contributor's Solana wallet address.

3. **Review and Approval**

   Project maintainers review the submitted moves. If a move meets all criteria and is valid, it is approved.

4. **Payment**

   Approved bounties trigger the `payBounty.ts` script, which transfers the specified SOL amount to the contributor's wallet address. Transaction details are recorded in the respective YAML file.

5. **Record Keeping**

   All transactions, including payout statuses and transaction hashes, are documented in the `.bounties` folder for transparency.
