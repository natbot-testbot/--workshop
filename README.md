## Project Purpose

The **Chess Bounty Workshop** aims to create a collaborative and transparent chess-playing environment leveraging GitHub's pull request workflow and the Solana blockchain for rewarding participants. By integrating smart contracts and automated workflows, players can engage in chess games while earning cryptocurrency rewards for their strategic moves.

## Features

- **Collaborative Chess Gameplay:** Submit your chess moves via GitHub PRs to participate in ongoing games.
- **SOL Bounties:** Earn Solana (SOL) rewards for each accepted move, incentivizing active participation.
- **Transparent Transactions:** All bounty payments are recorded in the `.bounties` directory for accountability.
- **Automated Bounty Payouts:** Streamlined process using GitHub Actions and Solana scripts to handle payments.
- **Game Validation:** Ensure the integrity of games with automated validation scripts.
- **AI Assistance:** Utilize AI for analyzing games and suggesting optimal moves.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 20.x.x
- **PNPM:** Version 9.x.x
- **TypeScript:** Installed globally or as a project dependency
- **Solana Wallet:** For receiving bounties
- **Git:** For cloning the repository and managing PRs

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ngundotra/--workshop.git
   cd --workshop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have `pnpm` installed. If not, install it globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

   Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file based on the provided example:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Populate the `.env` file with your Solana private key and RPC URL:

   ```dotenv
   SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Configuration

- **.env File:** Configure your Solana wallet and OpenAI API key.
  
- **Bounties Directory (`.bounties`):** Manage and record bounty payouts. Each PR corresponds to a YAML file detailing the payout information.

## Usage

### Playing Chess

1. **Submit a Move**

   - Fork the repository and navigate to the chess games directory.

   - Locate the latest game PGN file in `chess/games/`.

   - Edit the PGN file by adding your next move in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).

   - Include your Solana wallet address in the PR description.

   - Submit a pull request with your move.

2. **Earn Bounties**

   - If your move is accepted by the maintainers, a bounty in SOL will be sent to your provided Solana wallet address.

   - Previous bounty payments are recorded in the `.bounties` folder.

### Running Scripts

- **Validate Games**

  ```bash
  pnpm run validate-games
  ```

- **Create a New Game**

  ```bash
  pnpm run create-new-game
  ```

- **AI Chess Assistant**

  Analyze and suggest moves using AI:

  ```bash
  pnpm ts-node chess/scripts/aiChessAssistant.ts path/to/game.pgn
  ```

### GitHub Actions

Automated workflows handle bounty payouts and game validations:

- **Pay Bounty on Merge:** Triggered when a PR is merged into the main branch.
- **Validate New Chess Games:** Ensures that new or modified game files are valid.

## Bounty Payout Process

Bounties are managed through a structured and transparent process to ensure fairness and accountability.

1. **Bounty Creation:** Defined in YAML files within the `.bounties` directory. Each file specifies the task, reward, and completion criteria.

2. **Task Completion:** Contributors submit their moves via PRs. Upon approval, the associated bounty is eligible for payout.

3. **Review and Approval:** Maintainers review the submitted moves. Approved moves trigger the payout process.

4. **Payment:** Bounties are paid out in SOL using automated scripts. Transaction details are recorded in the corresponding YAML file.

5. **Record Keeping:** All transactions and bounty completions are logged in the `.bounties` directory for transparency.
